Simple C++ ORM for SQLite.
Originally this was made to support simple cases in iOS games. For example storing scores.

The ORM supports foreign collections and lazy loading.

=== Dependencies ===
- Sqlite3pp (included. see ext)
- boost.bind, boost.any and some other boost libraries

=== Usage ===
For basic usage information please see my blog post: http://alex.tapmania.org/2011/12/simple-sqlite-orm-for-c.html
and the example project included.

- Raw SQL
db_.execute(sql.c_str());

- Query with arguments
std::map<std::string, boost::any> a;
a[":score"] = 100000;
a[":user_id"] = user.get_id();

boost::shared_ptr<score> r = score_dao_obj.query_first(
   "WHERE user_id = :user_id AND score >= :score", a);

if(score)
{
    cout << "Found score higher than 100000 for user with the given ID.\n";
}
